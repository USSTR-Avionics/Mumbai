# Purposes and Scope

The flight computer should be a general purpose flight computer that allows us to have high performance, modularity,
encapsulation and object oriented design. Provide unparalledled situational awarenedd using edge functions on the
lambda cloud. All instructions and code are encrypted using null key encryption and single source of truth blockchain
technologies to avoid tampering with the data.

# Functional Requirements

## Materials
- microcontroller
    - STM32F405RGT6
    - debug/ program pins (should be programmable via USB)

- attitude sensors
    - accelerometer
    - gyroscope
    - magnetometer
    - barometer

- IO peripherals
    - multi-colour LED arrays
    - buzzer
    - external memory (try to use the same chips as the RF board)

- communication
    - CAN transceiver

# Non-functional Requirements

- sensor redundancy
    - accelerometer
    - gyroscope
    - magnetometer
    - barometer

# Assumptions and Dependencies

All of it will work
