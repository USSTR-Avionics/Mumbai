# Purposes and Scope

The flight computer should be a general purpose flight computer that allows us to have high performance, modularity,
encapsulation and object oriented design. Provide unparalledled situational awarenedd using edge functions on the
lambda cloud. All instructions and code are encrypted using null key encryption and single source of truth blockchain
technologies to avoid tampering with the data.
