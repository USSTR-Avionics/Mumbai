# Introduction

Welcome to our hardware-based repository, dedicated to providing innovative designs for modular boards that utilize the CANbus interface. At our repository, we strive to bring the benefits of modularity to hardware design, allowing for greater flexibility, scalability, and customization. Our designs are built using the robust and reliable CANbus interface, ensuring efficient communication and seamless integration between modules. Whether you're a hardware enthusiast, a researcher, or an engineer looking to build custom hardware solutions, our repository has something to offer. Our goal is to create a community of like-minded individuals who are passionate about hardware design, and we invite you to join us on this exciting journey. Browse our collection of designs, collaborate with others, and let's push the boundaries of what's possible with modular hardware.
